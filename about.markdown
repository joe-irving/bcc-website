We the Barbican Community Centre are a non-hierarchical group of individuals that share a vision of self-organised, community-led spaces in the city of York. We believe that everybody has a right to shelter and community, and our mission is to help meet these needs for the People of York and place pressure on decision-makers and businesses to faciliate this.

Given the huge number of empty buildings and second homes in the UK, and the excessive influence of profit-driven developers over our planning system, we believe that [occupying](/whysquat) empty land and buildings is both an effective and morally justified way of achieving this aim.

As such, our group began with the occupation of the unused land beside the York Barbican in order to turn it into community centre and space.

Since 22 July we have been occupying, without permission, the former Fibbers music venue, 3-5 Toft Green, and are in the process of turning it into a pay-as-you-feel cafe, radical library, events space and music venue.

## About the Barbican site

In 2007, after [a long fight](https://web.archive.org/web/20120208103108/http://saveourbarbicanyork.org.uk/pages/sob_york_campaign_history.htm),
the Barbican Swimming Pool was demolished. For 15 years this land has remained
empty while rich property developers sit on it just waiting for the price to go
up.

> We don't think that is right.

That is why on 19th June 2021 a group of us set about cleaning up the site and making
it a space for the community again. If the council won't then we have to
take matters into our own hands!

Now is the chance for us **all** to build something amazing.

Sadly, just 7 days after our clean up and rebuild started,
[Persimmon Homes](https://www.persimmonhomes.com/) violently and illegally
evicted us. This is not the end, we will fight this and we will not go silent.

Despite being a short project, this has brought together a community in York - which will always be stronger than any eviction team.
