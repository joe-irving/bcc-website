# About

In the early 2000s, after [a long fight](https://web.archive.org/web/20120208103108/http://saveourbarbicanyork.org.uk/pages/sob_york_campaign_history.htm),
the Barbican Swimming Pool was demolished. For 15 years this land has remained
empty while rich property developers sit on it just waiting for the price to go
up.

> We don't think that is right.

That is why on 19th June 2021 a group of us set about cleaning up the site and making
it a space for the community again. If the council won't then we have to
take matters into our own hands!

Now is the chance for us **all** to build something amazing for your.
