# About

In 2007, after [a long fight](https://web.archive.org/web/20120208103108/http://saveourbarbicanyork.org.uk/pages/sob_york_campaign_history.htm),
the Barbican Swimming Pool was demolished. For 15 years this land has remained
empty while rich property developers sit on it just waiting for the price to go
up.

> We don't think that is right.

That is why on 19th June 2021 a group of us set about cleaning up the site and making
it a space for the community again. If the council won't then we have to
take matters into our own hands!

Now is the chance for us **all** to build something amazing.

Sadly, just 7 days after our clean up and rebuild started,
[Persimmon Homes](https://www.persimmonhomes.com/) violently and illegally
evicted us. This is not the end, we will fight this and we will not go silent.

Despite being a short project, this has brought together a community in York - which will always be stronger than any eviction team. 

Things you can do now:

* [Join the mailing list](https://lists.riseup.net/www/subscribe/barbicancommunitycentre)
* [Sign the petition](http://chng.it/DD6GPNVCHb)

And make sure you come along to any people's assemblies, events, gigs and everything else when we run it. And if you have anything you want to run, just ask the mailing list!
