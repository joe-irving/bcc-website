# About

In 2007, after [a long fight](https://web.archive.org/web/20120208103108/http://saveourbarbicanyork.org.uk/pages/sob_york_campaign_history.htm),
the Barbican Swimming Pool was demolished. For 15 years this land has remained
empty while rich property developers sit on it just waiting for the price to go
up.

> We don't think that is right.

That is why on 19th June 2021 a group of us set about cleaning up the site and making
it a space for the community again. If the council won't then we have to
take matters into our own hands!

Now is the chance for us **all** to build something amazing.

Sadly, just 7 days after our clean up and rebuild started,
[Persimmon Homes](https://www.persimmonhomes.com/) violently and illegally
evicted us. This is not the end, we will fight this and we will not go silent.

Join us on Saturday 26th June for a
[protest against this eviction](/news/protest-the-eviction/).
