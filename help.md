# Help us

## Things we need

Right now, we need to show Persimmon Homes that the people of York do not want
them to sit on the land holding it hostage from the people of York. [Join us
in protest](/news/protest-the-eviction/) over the illegal and violent eviction.

## Find us

You can find us just of Kent Street (opposite the bus stop). Feel free to
pop in when you have the time! This is a space for all people of York.
