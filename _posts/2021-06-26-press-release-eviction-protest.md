## What we are doing and why?

**Today, we the People of York are gathering outside the Barbican Community Centre to demand that this land be returned to the people.** We are protesting the violent and illegal eviction perpetrated yesterday by Persimmon Homes Ltd, which was supported and facilitated by North Yorkshire Police. There will be speeches, music and arts, and we will call loudly and publicly on Persimmon Homes to stop hoarding land for private profit and for the council to compulsorily purchase the site so we can build something to support our local community in York.

## We demand:
1.    An immediate Compulsory Purchase Order to reclaim the land for £1 and return it to the people of York, as Persimmon Homes property obstructs a project which is for the “greater public good”
2.    A people’s assembly to return power to the People of York via deliberative direct democracy, which will give local people the power to decide how such spaces are used
3.    That planning permission is rescinded for all new hotels and luxury apartments and begin a massive program of building carbon-negative social housing
4.    That land banking be made illegal so that land is used for the benefit of people and not hoarded for private profits

## Background

In 2007 the swimming pool that was on the Barbican Community Centre (BCC) site was demolished and the land sold for nearly £7 million. Nearly 15 years later, the land has been left to rot, nothing has been built and Persimmon Homes Ltd asking for £20 million for the same land. This is a flagrant example of land banking, with a private company hoarding land to profit from price speculation to the detriment of the local community, who are barred from this space. They care about their profits, not about the people of York.

We, the founders of Barbican Community Centre, occupied this site on Tuesday 15 June, and continuously occupied it from Thursday 17 June. We picked litter, made the site safe and clean, and we started turning it into a multi-purpose community space. We built a shed, made plans to make raised beds, grow vegetables, host a library and open the space to the community for all kinds of purposes. We also made it clear that it was a welcome and safe space for travellers and homeless people to stay.

## An illegal and violent eviction

This beautiful project ended abruptly on Friday 25 June, when at 6:30am private contractors from a company called “Court Enforcement Specialists”, working for Persimmon Homes Ltd, entered the site without notice and forcibly removed everybody, physically carrying one of off the site and criminally assaulting him in the process, causing injury to his neck and hand (see attached photos). Nobody on-site knew of the eviction until they entered squatted land without permission, which is illegal because we have rights as squatters and the owners must acquire a High Court possession order to remove us from the property. North Yorkshire Police facilitated the eviction, helping them enter and leave the site. An officer said that it was a matter of civil law, yet they helped the private contractors conduct an illegal eviction. The officer also dismissed the injury done, stating that “reasonable force” can be used, even though they arguably amount to criminal assault. The police supported private landowners and protected property, they were not there to protect the squatters or ensure their safety.
