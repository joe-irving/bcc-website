Join us for our first People's Assembly to decide the future of the Barbican Community Centre! This will be a family friendly and Covid-Safe event, so bring your kids, wear a mask, and maintain social distancing. We will be meeting outside of the coop on Paragon Street.

We will be mixing up discussion, fun and an open mic for the afternoon. By the end we should have a plan for how the Barbican Community Centre will live on
